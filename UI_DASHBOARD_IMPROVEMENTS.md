# Hydroponics Dashboard UI Improvements

## Overview
This document describes the improvements made to the user interface for the hydroponics system dashboard. The new UI provides a more visually appealing and organized display of sensor data with better grouping and styling.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Modern Dashboard Layout
- Organized sensor data into logical groups:
  - Water Quality (pH and EC levels)
  - Climate (Temperature and Humidity)
  - Lighting (Lux measurement)
  - Air Quality (CO2 levels)

### 2. Enhanced Visual Design
- Added container boxes with shadows and rounded corners for each sensor group
- Implemented a consistent color scheme:
  - Primary blue for titles and important elements
  - Clean white backgrounds for containers
  - Gray text for labels and units
- Improved typography with better font sizing and spacing

### 3. Better Data Presentation
- Clear separation between parameter names, values, and units
- Larger, more readable numeric values
- Consistent alignment and spacing for better readability

## UI Components

### Main Screen Layout
```
+-----------------------------------------+
|       Hydroponics Dashboard             |
+----+------+  +----+------+  +----------+
| pH Level |  | EC Level |  | Lighting |
|          |  |          |  |          |
|   6.80   |  | 1.50     |  |  1200    |
+----+------+  +----+------+  +----------+
+-----------------------------------------+
|              Climate                    |
| Temp: 24.5 C      Humidity: 65.0 %      |
+-----------------------------------------+
+----------------+  +---------------------+
|   Air Quality  |  |                     |
|                |  |                     |
|     420 ppm    |  |                     |

### Color Scheme
- Primary Color: #1976D2 (Blue)
- Secondary Color: #4CAF50 (Green)
- Warning Color: #FF9800 (Orange)
- Danger Color: #F44336 (Red)
- Background: #F5F5F5 (Light Gray)
- Text: #212121 (Dark Gray)
- Secondary Text: #757575 (Light Gray)

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
- `components/lvgl_main/lvgl_main.c` - Complete rewrite of the UI creation and update logic

### New Features
1. Container-based Layout: Each sensor group is contained in its own visually distinct box
2. Improved Styling: Consistent styling with shadows, rounded corners, and proper spacing
3. Better Organization: Logical grouping of related sensors
4. Enhanced Readability: Larger fonts for values, clear separation of units

### Technical Implementation
- Uses LVGL (Light and Versatile Graphics Library) for rendering
- Thread-safe implementation with proper mutex handling
- Non-blocking queue-based data updates
- Memory-efficient design with proper resource cleanup

## Usage
The dashboard automatically displays sensor data as it's received from the various sensors in the system:
- pH sensor
- EC sensor
- Temperature and humidity sensor
- Light sensor
- CO2 sensor

Values update in real-time every 2 seconds as new data is received from the sensors.
